It works in a very simple way!

First, you add a large block of text containing the items you want to memorize, such as "Tokyo, New York, Beijing, Rome." Notice how I put a comma after each word;
this is how the program identifies each individual part. Then, the program picks one word at random until it finishes them all, at which point it loops back.In this case
we are memorizing what city belong to what country. It also has a live link is you want to try!
